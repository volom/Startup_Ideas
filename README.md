# Startup_Ideas
This project is designed to collect ideas from existing startups and store this information in the SQL database. Often you need to analyze existing ideas to come up with your own;)
--------------------
sups_dirs.txt - links with info about existing startups, potentially intended for parsing

run_parsers.py - MAIN script which runs all parsers the project contains. The script will be changed in the future if new parsers are created

convert_db2csv - convert existing SQL database into .csv format
